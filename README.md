## Problem set: Read the MNIST data files

These problems relate to the famous MNIST data set. Save your work as a Python file, or a collection of Python files. 

1. Read the data files

Download the image and label files. Have Python decompress and read them byte by byte into appropriate data structures in memory.

2. Output an image to the console

Output the third image in the training set to the console. Do this by representing any pixel value less than 128 as a full stop and any other pixel value as a hash symbol.

3. Output the image files as PNGs

Use Python to output the image files as PNGs, saving them in a subfolder in your repository.
